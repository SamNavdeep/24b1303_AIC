The one month plan for the AI hackathon is as follows:
week 1: selection of the problem and collecting the basic data
week 2: data analysis and preprocessing
week 3: model selection and taining 
week 4: final risk planning and milestone tracking

now getting started with the first week's plan, mostly the first week's time would be utilised in the creation of a problem statement and determining the feasibility of the problem.:
start with the problem statement of the AI hackathon. the team must brainstorm on the segment in which it wants to make the participants to complete the hackathon. the team must make sure that they keep the problem statement innovative and new. For example if we choose a sector which is image recognition. now we need to ponder on what to set as the question which needs to be framed. the team must also think about various possibilities within image recognition- character recoginition, lets assume we select it. now we can frame a question on text classification application. so one such application is generation of a model which reads the question when it is sent to it in pdf format, evaluates the question and types the ans in the pdf and returns the pdf back with the ans present in it.(we donot assume that the model gives ans to all types of questions rather to specific topic and some specific questions as of now). the team must now start to gather images from the internet through Source public datasets like Kaggle, UCI, HuggingFace Datasets, to carry on the character recognition/ word recognition.

for the second week, now the team has gathered the data now it is the time to preprocess the entire data. first of all retrive the data. resize them into some specific amount of size. now change the number of channels.now you get the numpy array of the dataset. divide the data into test and the validation sets. nearly 80% of the data must be saved as the training data and rest for the validation. team must analyse the data which they have got, like observing the size and determing the batch size. identify data issues like leakage, imbalance etc. also take the help of histograms, graphs etc to accurately unfderstand the data which we have got.

model selection is very crucial, being determined the task which we have to do determine the perfect model for it. for the example it is vgg16, say. now we need to start training. now freezing all the layers we need to introduce the head layer containg the informtaion of the number of inputs and the outputs which you want in which we mention the loss and train it using the dataset. now unfreeze the layers of the pretrained model.
finally finetune the model. also keep the track of the accuracy and other aspects. keep track of the milestones reached. also check the amount of RAM and storage required, change accordingly the amount of data if it exceeds the desirable values. assign roles to all the members- data engineer- collects all the data, ML engineer- finetunes the model, debugging engineers, validation members, and other who prepares the report and elps in promoting the hacathon, i.e non technical stuff. Finally there is risk management- also keep a backup plan incase if there is any flaw in the preceedings of the hacakhton.
