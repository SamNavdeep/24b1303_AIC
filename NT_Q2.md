hello,let me give you brief intro about myself. I am Sam Navdeep, a freshie of electrical engineering dept. I am a telugu guy, currently living in MP. I have interest in playing badminton, TT and chess. i also find my deep interest in series and animes (especially the thriller ones).

To be frank this was my first time learning AIML, so I learnt it from scratch (not good level though, but i have gathered decent level of understanding of the underlying mechanisms which are required for the model to run), moreover I learnt python basics also during my research on AIML. these 2 weeks were hectic, constantly gathering information and trying to understand python and AIML. yet I very much enjoyed doing it.

now coming to my goals and motivations:
motivation: 
1.I am not much interested in CS though, but this segment of CS keeps fascinating me all the time, how computer without having eyes can read the text, classify the images. i always wanted to understand this, finally i got a chance to dwell in this area and felt it to be more interesting than expected. I want to know more and improve myself in this segment
2. AIML has a good scope in future, and if i want persue non core this would be beneficial.

Goals and what i want to learn:
1. To better understand in this gement and gain practical experience by working in a team
2. I am somewhat introverted so i want to increase my connections 
3. not only the tech stuff, i want to also learn non tech stuff ex postermaking, editing etc.
4. to take part in various competitions and interIITs.


my contributions:
eventhough, this is my first time doing the AIML, I am sure that i would improve with consistant efforts, which i am highly interested to put in. I always try to complete the job given, hence i would not be a disapointment for you. i would also take part in brainstorming and coordinate in the teamwork. i will also work in the non technical segment aswell.
